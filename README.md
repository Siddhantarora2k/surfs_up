2. Convert them into a list and further into a DataFrame.
3. Eventually, Get summary statistics of the DataFrame.

### Summary 
The data shows temperature of __JUNE__ and __DECEMBER__ from all different stations.
So, another query I would do is 
- filter the data by only that station where the temperature is more frequently updated.
- I already did the query where temperature data is shown after 30th june and 31st december
